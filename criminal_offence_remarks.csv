CRIMINAL_OFFENCE_CODE;STATE_ID;DEFINITION
T11TC;4;Concerning traffic offences, please see below.
T11TC;6;"The police statistics contain no contraventions concerning the traffic code/traffic regulation. This is a separate reporting by the office ""traffic"" of the police. Nevertheless the Penal code contains some articles that refer to traffic and these articles are part of the police statistics. Somme examples:   - malicious obstruction of traffic  - unintentional killing caused by a traffic accident  - undeliberate beating in injuries caused by a traffic accident  - caused a train accident  Also some violations of Special laws are party of the Police statistics, namely,   - Traffic-tax   - regulation concerning transport    Since 2005, there exist also ""mixed offenses"" (vandalism, graffiti, noise by night, ...) If the public Prosecutor decides not to prosecute, those offenses can be punished with a municipal administrative sanction . Those ""mixed offenses"" are included in the Police statistics regardless of the subsequent consequences (legal or administrative)"
T11TC;8;Police statistics exclude all crimes against the Republic of Bulgaria (treason, espionage, etc.), crimes against the country’s defense capacity, military crimes, crimes against peace and humanity, and crimes committed abroad.
T11TC;9;Police ceased to collect data on offences prosecuted by private action or upon request and therefore minor theft and some forms of fraud cannot be included in police statistics.
T11TC;11;in statistics are included all acts that are a criminal offense, proceedings on minor offences are subject to the provisions on administrative proceedings
T11TC;12;Criminal offences is defined as penal law violations and the traffic offences mentioned below. Other offences related to special laws are not included.   Please observe that there is no separate statistics on reported traffic law offences (i.e. police statistics), so the number reported under 'police statistics' concerns all types of penal desision, i.e. including dropped cahrages etc. The same goes for the previous statistics.
T11TC;13;Minor theft and other minor property offences: not possible to give an exact answer. Before 15.03.2007 repeated minor property offences were recorded as crimes. During the period 15.03.2007-27.07.2008 such offences were always defined as misdemeanours. From 28.07.2008 first and second offence are defined as misdemeanaours, and third etc offence is defined as a crime.     Drug-related misdemeanours are excluded, although they are included in 'Drug offences - Total'
T11TC;15;Contraventions of the 5the class (max penalty fine 1500 euros) are included. Convictions for the 1st to 4th classes are excluded since data about these convictions do not come from the same source and do not give any breakdown by specific offences.  Police statistics do not include all criminal offences. Offences linked to economic and administrative policing (labour, consumption, environment customs...) are excluded.
T11TC;17;Police statistics do not count traffic offences.     Conviction statistics in addition to severe road traffic offences (as defined below) also include traffic offences outside road traffic, driving without a motor liability insurance, driving without paying motor vehicle tax and driving without or using wrong number plates.
T11TC;19;Statistics imply the traffic infringements that are crimes.
T11TC;20;only included if subject to proceedings inside the criminal justice system.
T11TC;21;Total recorded criminal offences is not available.
T11TC;23;On the Police Statistics are included all cases that are reported to the Police even if further investigation will find out that it is not an criminal offence.
T11TC;24;Traffic offences excluded unless they have lead to injuries, deaths or serious damage to property.  As a rule, breaches of public order regulations (e.g. consumption of alcohol in public outside pubs/other designated places or riding on a bus without a valid ticket) in Latvia fall outside the criminal offence category. They are regarded as “administrative” offences.  Most traffic offences are not subject to the competence of criminal justice. However, if such an offence resulted in injury or death of the victim (even unintended), it would normally fall into the criminal offences category.
T11TC;25;In the CC (Art.178. 3) the responsibility for minor theft (when the value is from 130 to 390 Lt. (37.6 – 113 €). When the value is smaller than 130 Lt., criminal responsibility does not exist, in this case there is possible only administrative responsibility (Art. 50). The presented statistical data involves only the theft as crimes.
T11TC;31;"All traffic offences are excluded from the Penal Code and are under ""Misdemeanour against the Road Traffic Act"" of which the figure for traffic offences is calculated from and added to the total record of criminal offences. Only minor breaches of public order regulations are excluded from total crime. Drug offences are not included to the Penal Code but are under various legal definitions. Thus I have used the figure in ""Crime against the Act relating to medicinal goods etc."" and added it to the total"
T11TC;32;Data according to criminal offences committed by minors in conviction statistics include only most serious offences (minors in general criminal proceedings).
T11TC;33;Juveniles under 16 years of age are not criminally responsible and therefore cannot be subjected to criminal proceedings. But, if a juvenile under 16 comes to the attention of the police as a probable perpetrator of a crime he/she is counted as a suspect for statistical purposes, although only care and protection measures may be used in his/her regard. In conviction statistics only juveniles less than 16 years of age are excluded.
T11TC;37;If a “Minor property offence” or a “Minor violent offence” is considered a misdemeanour, then it is NOT included.
T11TC;39;The Spanish Criminal Code foresees three types of offences: Misdemeanours (faltas), Less Serious Crimes (Delitos menos graves), and Serious Crimes (Delitos graves). Data in this questionnaire refers to Less Serious Crimes and Serious Crimes. Misdemeanours are excluded. Total offences refer to Book II of the Spanish Criminal Code, arts. 138 to 616.
T11TC;43;Police statistics that are currently available are very poor. We are expecting that in February 2013 new statistics will be published. So hopefully, for the final data collection, police statistics will be much better.
T11TC;44;Breaches of public order regulation classified in two groups: minor breaches of public order regulation (minor hooliganism), regulated by the Code of Ukraine of administrative offences of 1984. Minor breaches of public order include using of obscene language, clinging people and other unconditional behavior in public places. Major breaches of public order regulation (hooliganism) are regulated by the Criminal Code of Ukraine:
T11TC;45;Some major traffic offences are included.
T11TT;3;In 1.2 many of the offences which were asked to be included in the number of severe road traffic offences  do not constitute a crime in Armenia and thus it was not possible to show their numbers. For example, dangerous driving is an administrative offence unless it leads to death or severe injuring of a person or causes serious damage. The same is true also for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and because of that BAC was not mentioned in point 1.2.a.
T11TT;4;The reports include §§ 80, 81, 88, 89, 94, 95 StGB. Also these offences are not especially aiming at traffic offences but also cover them, if they apply.    General hit-and-run driving is not a criminal offence but and administration offence.  But if a person is injured in a traffice accident a criminal offences applies (§ 94 StGB - Imstichlassen eines Verletzten).
T11TT;6;Alcohol concentration betwenn 0.5 and 0.8 g/l blood or between 0.22 and 0.35mg/l exhaled air : alert  More tha 0.8g/l or 0.35mg /l exhaled air : positive
T11TT;8;Both police and conviction statistics cover all punishable traffic affecting all types of transport. Both police and conviction statistics include more crimes than listed in the definition like for example forgery of number plates.  The general blood alcohol content (BAC) above which driving is considered criminal is 1.2 per mille. There is a special BAC in cases of reoffending: once a person gets convicted for driving with a BAC over 1.2 per mille the next such incident will be considered a criminal offence if the person has a BAC of more than 0.5 per mille.
T11TT;9;"Driving under the influence of alcohol (0.5 BAC and above) is punishable as a misdemeanour according to the Road Traffic Safety Act (art. 199) but it is not a criminal offence per se. Driving under the influence of (drugs or) alcohol constitutes a criminal offence only when the driver causes an accident in which another is seriously bodily injured or extensive material damage is caused to another (or death of one or more person is caused – aggravated form). The same applies to driving while disqualified or impaired for other reasons. Major traffic offences in Croatia cover only those offences in which a participant in road traffic, by violating regulations on traffic safety, endangers the traffic in such a manner that s/he causes an accident that entails consequences described above. Dangerous/reckless driving is therefore included only to the extent that it actually causes serious damage to property/injury of another.  Serious endangerment of road traffic in other ways (by removing signs, etc.) may constitute other criminal offences (against public safety), but does not constitute a traffic offence and cannot be included in the statistics on traffic offences.  Hit-and-run driving is included, but only when the driver fails to render aid to a person who suffers serious bodily injury in a traffic accident.  Croatian Criminal Code incriminates “Causing Traffic Accident” which covers all forms of traffic; hence, it is not possible to exclude offences committed outside road traffic.  The new Criminal Code, which enters into force on January 1, 2013 will completely change the concept of traffic offences in Croatia, but this is not relevant for the current survey."
T11TT;11;no fixed limit, in practice is considered more than 1.0 per thousand as boundary value with the offense of Threat under the Influence of Addictive Substances, 0.3 per mille for misdemeanor  Prosecution and conviction statistics show major traffic offences (called “criminal offences in transport”), police statistics record traffic accidents.
T11TT;12;Cannot separate between different reasons for driving without a valid license
T11TT;13;"Causing negligent injury is a criminal offence if the injury is 'serious'; other incidents are misdemeanours."
T11TT;17;Police statistics do not count traffic offences.
T11TT;18;BAC= 1.10 g/l
T11TT;21;50mg alcohol per 100ml9.
T11TT;22;Limit of BAC 0.0 g/L for people under 21 years
T11TT;25;The criminal responsibility only for negligent homicide and negligent injury in road traffic in CC is provided. Other traffic offences presented in the table are administrative offences.    Concerning BAC:  If one drives an automobile or motorcycle and has not less than 2 years driving experience, then BAC is 0,4 ‰. If one drives any kind of transport vehicle and has less than 2 years driving experience, also if one drives heavy transport or passenger transport, then BAC is 0,2 ‰.
T11TT;31;It is difficult to determine major traffic crimes from Norwegian statistics. The figure in ESB5 is from Misdemeanours against the Road Act where all traffic offences are put into.   Major traffic offences include:  Driving under influence of alcohol  Without driving licence  Illegal speed  Injury of person
T11TT;33;The clarification provided by this new table ordered a review of selected crimes to match the concept of serious road crimes. For this reason the series should be revised.  Does not include the crime of driving under the influence of drugs but only the crime of driving under the influence of alcohol.
T11TT;35;Date covers years 2007-2011. Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol presumes only the cases when the driver has committed a road traffic offense.  • Source: Main Directorate for Road Traffic Safety of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia
T11TT;39;Data on major traffic offences refer to arts. 379 to 385 of the Spanish Criminal Code (XXX)  • DRIVING OVER SPEED  • DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL  OR DRUGS    • REFUSAL TO SUBMIT THE ALCOHOLEMIA TEST   • RECKLESS DRIVING  • DRIVING WITHOUT PERMISSION OR LICENSE  • TO CAUSE A SERIOUS RISK TO TRAFFIC   • OTHER, AGAINST ROAD SAFETY
T11TT;43;Police data not available
T11TT;44;1. All acts defined in the Criminal Code of Ukraine are preceded in the criminal justice system.  Other types of offences (e.g. administrative offences) are treated under special proceedings and excluded from criminal statistics. Minor traffic offences including drunk driving are punishable by the Code of Ukraine of administrative offences of 1984.  Some of them are fined by the courts and disposed in court statistics. These statistical records are different from the criminal statistics.
T11TT;47;1.2a is given as g/L    Negligent homicide in road traffic is a separately identifiable offence, but causing injury is not.
T11HO;2;"The assault leading to death is foreseen in the second paragraph of the article 88 ""Assaults""  The negligent killing at the police statistics can not be excluded for the year 2007, 2008, 2009."
T11HO;3;There is no special data for assaults leading to death. This issues are covered under the data for assaults.
T11HO;4;included: §§ 75-77, 79, 86 StGB
T11HO;6;Assault leading to death without the intent to kill are registered in another category than homicied.    Since 2002, euthanasia is allowed under certain conditions. In cas those conditions are not fulfilled, the case is considered as an homicide.
T11HO;8;The negligent killing of a person as a result of intentional assault is excluded from the definition because it is considered a form of negligent homicide. Preparation for and incitement to homicide is also excluded.
T11HO;11;"Infanticide is included in police statistics under “murder” but counted separately. Therefore figures in all the tables show intentional homicide only (infanticide – murder of a new born infant by its mother – is a separate crime).  Causing death due to bodily harm is part of facts of the case of crimes ""bodily injury"".  From 1.1. 2010 is a new Criminal Code effective in the Czech Republic - contains apart from murder new criminal offense of manslaughter:   Section 141   Manslaughter   (1) Whoever intentionally kills another person because of strong agitation out of fear, dismay, confusion, or another excusable mind set or as a result of the previous reprehensible conduct of the victim, they shall be punished by a prison sentence of three to ten years.      (2) A prison sentence of five to fifteen years will be imposed upon an offender should they commit an act referred to in Subsection 1   a) on two or more persons,   b) on a pregnant woman, or   c) on a child under the age of fifteen years."
T11HO;13;Penal Code (PC) §§113-114.
T11HO;18;With respect to conviction statistics homicide “exclude” means that  attempts are listed separately from completed homicide. In other words, data referring to convictions cover both completed and attempted homicide but attempts are shown separately from completed homicide.
T11HO;19;Abortion is only included, if it is considered to be a criminal offence (businesslike conduct, without the consent of the victim, causing her serious bodily injury)
T11HO;23;According to the Penal Code of Kosovo they are in general 5 articles regarding Homicide (Murder article 146, Agravatted Murder article 147, Murder Committed in a State of Mental Distress article 148, Negligent Murder article 149, Murder of Infants During Birth article 150). They are also foreseen tw other separate articles such as article 151 (Inciting Suicide and Assisting in Suicide) and article 152 (Impermissible Termination of Pregnancy)
T11HO;25;The statistics of intentional homicide include: Murder (Art.129), murder in a state of affect (Art. 130), murder of a baby (Art.131).  Formally, there are some types of offences (for instance,– crimes against humanity) that include the intentional homicide, e.g. genocide, killing the persons that are protected by International humanitarian law, terror act etc., and therefore theoretically there is a possibility that some intentional homicides might not be included in the statistic. But actually this has a very little impact on the statistics of the intentional homicides.
T11HO;30;Euthanasia and abortion, although present in criminal law, hardly ever occur. If certain conditions are met (and usually they are) it is not punishable.
T11HO;31;Includes manslaughter
T11HO;35;Russian Criminal Code normally excludes preparation to commit crimes from prosecution. There is, however, art.30 of Criminal Code which states that preparation to commit aggravated (max. sentence – 10 years) and high crimes (max. sentence – more than 10 years) are ‘counted’ as ‘committed’ crimes. As for attempts, there are no such restrictions hence in this questionnaire we normally mark attempts to commit crimes as included in both police and conviction statistics. Nevertheless, all depends on the character of attempts and in some cases attempts may be excluded from conviction (for instance, in case with legal minor attempting to commit a minor crime for the first time). Thus, homicide and attempted homicide are not separated in the Russian police statistics/  • Source: The Ministry of the Interior of Russian Federation
T11HO;36;"Intentional homicide includes the following criminal offences: murder, aggravated murder, manslaughter in a heat of passion, infanticide, and euthanasia. This is included in the conviction statistics, but in the police statistics only murder and aggravated murder is included.    Additional information on the definitions in the CC of the Republic of Serbia:  Murder  Whoever deprives another of life shall be punished by a term of imprisonment of  between five and fifteen years’ duration.  Aggravated Murder  Whoever:  1) causes the death of another in a cruel or insidious manner;  2) causes the death of another by callous violent behaviour;  3) causes the death of another and in doing so wilfully endangers the life of another  person;  4) causes the death of another during the commission of a robbery or compound  larceny,  5) causes the death of another for gain, in order to commit or conceal another offence,  from callous revenge or other base motives;  6) causes the death of a public official or serviceman during the performance of their  official duties;  7) causes the death of a judge, public prosecutor, deputy public prosecutor or a police  officer in connection with the discharge of their duties;  8) causes the death of persons performing duties in the public interest in connection with  the discharge of their duties;  9) causes the death of a child or a pregnant woman;  10) causes the death of a member of his family whom he previously abused;  11) wilfully causes the death of more than one person, but not in the form of  manslaughter, infanticide or mercy killing, or in a heat of passion.  shall be punished with a term of imprisonment of at least ten years or from thirty to forty  years.  Manslaughter in the Heat of Passion  Whoever causes the death of another while brought into a sudden heat of passion, through no fault of his own, by an attack, physical abuse or serious verbal abuse committed by the person killed, shall be punished with imprisonment of from one to eight  years.  Infanticide  A mother who causes the death of her child at birth or immediately after delivery, while in a state of disorder caused by delivery, shall be punished with imprisonment of from six months to five years.  Mercy Killing  Whoever causes the death of an adult person out of mercy due to the serious state of health of such person and at a serious and explicit request by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of from six months to five years."
T11HO;39;Data on major traffic offenses refer to arts. 138 to 140 of the Spanish Criminal Code (intentional homicide and murder).
T11HO;41;assault leading to death > homicide yes or aggraved bodily injury > next...
T11HO;43;I am not sure what definition was used in the police statistics.
T11HO;44;Criminal Code of Ukraine defines intentional homicide (murder) and aggravated intentional homicide (murder) – parts 1 and 2 of article 115.  Infanticide is a type of intentional homicide, but is regulated by separate article of the Code - article 117. Under the Criminal Code of Ukraine euthanasia is qualified as intentional homicide (part 1 of article 115).  Assistance with suicide is qualified as driving a person into suicide (article 120).  Assault leading to death can be qualified as unintentional homicide (article 119) or intended aggravated grievous bodily injury (article 121) depending on obstacles of the case. Threat of murder envisages separate criminal liability (article 129).
T11HO;45;Intentional killing is called 'Homicide' and includes offences of murder, manslaughted and infanticide. Attempted murders are recorded separately.
T11HO;47;The category of culpable homicide includes both assaults leading to death and death caused by negligence.  The only separately identifiable offence of negligent killing is corporate homicide.  Assistance with suicide is not a separately identifiable offence.
T11AS;3;It was impossible to separate the data for assaults leading to death.
T11AS;4;Included: §§ 83-85, 87 StGB
T11AS;6;"1) In case od ""Deliberate beating and injuries"", the police code don't allow to make a disctinction base on the condition of the victime (alive or dead)  2) The registration codes concern ""Beating and injuries"".   It is not possible to make a distinction between ""beatings"" on the one hand and ""injuries"" on the other."
T11AS;8;The inflicting of bodily injury because of severe irritation caused by the victim’s unlawful behavior is excluded from police statistics and included in conviction statistics.
T11AS;9;In order to include bodily injuries of public officials, police and conviction statistics cover the aggravated forms of offences “Obstructing an Official in the Performance of Official Duty” and “Attacking an Official” which refer to whoever, in the course of committing these offences, “maltreats, inflicts slight bodily injury on an official or threatens to use a weapon”.  Therefore, the statistics will probably include some cases in which an official is attacked without being injured (e.g. instances in which a public official is only being threatened).  This problem does not occur when an injury of a public official is serious as in such cases the offence is qualified as “Aggravated Bodily Injury” (in concurrence with one of the above specified offences against public order).  Bodily injury in a domestic disputes is counted as an ordinary (or aggravated) Bodily injury (in concurrence with the offence “Domestic violence”, which incriminates violent, abusive or particularly insolent conduct, but does not in itself cover bodily injuries).  In this edition we have therefore decided not to include as Bodily injuries the data on separate offence 'Domestic violence' (domestic violence is counted as a bodily injury only when it actually led to an injury). This may lead to a different result (different number of committed bodily injuries) with respect to year 2007 (in which the overall number of bodily injuries included all cases of 'Domestic violence' regardless of whether any injury actually occurred).
T11AS;11;The offense bodily injury means the infliction of harm or disturbance to health according to a practice lasting at least 7 days.  From 2010 new crime according to Section 146a Harm to Health out of Excusable Motives
T11AS;12;The section on violence against a public servant does not separate between violence and threats, but as the  information is included in the last version of ES I include it here as well.
T11AS;13;PC §§ 118, 121, 122. Minor assault (§121) or torture (§122) do not include bodily injury as an obligatory criterion – i.e only a (minor?) part of such offences have caused bodily injury.
T11AS;15;"Convictions for minor bodily injury, assault only causing pain (e.g.slapping):  5th class ""contravention"": assault without aggraving circumstances, temporary work incapacity not more than 8 days.  Violence without temporary work incapacity (no injury) and without aggraving circumstances is a 4th class contravention, excluded from conviction statistic. Aggraving circumstances depending on victims (e.g.minor) places (e.g.in public transports), ect lead to a ""delit"" even when there is no work incapacity."
T11AS;18;1. Bodily injury of a public servant does not constitute an independent offence.  2. Bodily injury in a domestic dispute constitutes an offence of a special law,   outside the Greek Criminal Code, concerning family violence. From  the point of view of statistics, however, bodily injury in a domestic dispute is not mentioned in a separate category. Hence, it is included in the general category of “bodily injury” .  3. Assault leading to death constitutes a “lethal bodily injury” and not homicide.  4. Assault only causing pain constitutes the so-called offence “minor injury”.  5. Negligent bodily injury constitutes an independent offence.
T11AS;19;Minor bodily injury/assault only causing pain: only included in statistics if the procedure is initiated by a private action (not a public cimre)
T11AS;20;Assault leading to death : Other than those filed as attempted murder
T11AS;23;They are to main articles regarding bodily injuries, article 153 (Light Bodily Harm) and 154 (Grievous Bodily Harm)
T11AS;25;Offences according to the CC: Intentional grave body injury (Art.135), Intentional grave body injury in a state of affect (Art.136), Intentional non-grave body injury (Art.138) There is another crime in the  CC, that might include easy body injury as an alternative act- causing pain or easy body injury (Art. 140).   Some intentional body injuries might not be  be in the statistics, because some types of crime may include body injuries by themselves, e.g. rape, robbery etc., but they are qualified as one (usually more severe) offence.
T11AS;30;The distinction between ‘normal’ assault and ‘aggravated’ assault is made according to the intent of the offender, not to the outcome.
T11AS;31;Includes following crimes:  Assault  Wounding or inflicting bodily harm  Inflicting grievous bodily harm
T11AS;32;Data include total number of domestic violence (like in previous edition of SBK) – not only bodily injury.
T11AS;33;The bodily injury of a public servant/official is not included in the sense of resistance to and coercion of the public servant/official to make him act against his duties.
T11AS;35;• Threats are recorded under the art. 119 of Russian Criminal Code (‘Threats to kill or commit bodily injury’).  • Slapping and punching is recorded under different article of Criminal Code (Art. 116-117)
T11AS;36;Under assault leading to death we consider the criminal offence of aggravated bodily injury that resulted in a death of an injured person. In such a context, the data on this form of aggravated bodily injury is included in the police and conviction statistics.    Additional information on the definitions in the CC of the Republic of Serbia:  Serious Bodily Harm   (1) Whoever causes to another serious injury or causes serious impairment of health, shall be punished with imprisonment of from six months to five years.  (2) Whoever causes to another serious injury or health impairment resulting in endangering of life of that person or destruction or permanent and considerable damage or weakening of a vital function of his body or an organ, or permanent serious health  impairment or disfigurement, shall be punished with imprisonment of one to eight years.  (3) If acts referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article result in the death of the injured person, the offender shall be punished with imprisonment of two to twelve years.  (4) Whoever commits the act referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article from negligence, shall be punished with imprisonment of up to three years.  (5) Whoever commits the act specified in paragraphs 1 through 3 of this Article in the heat of passion, if brought in a sudden heat of passions through no fault of his own by physical assault, physical abuse or serious insult of the injured person, shall be punished for the offence referred to in paragraph 1 by imprisonment of up to three years, and for the offence referred to in paragraph 2 by imprisonment of from three months to four years, and for the offence referred to in para 3 by imprisonment of six months to five years.  (6) If the act referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is committed against a minor, a pregnant women or a person who performs duties in public interest, the offender shall be punished with imprisonment of one to eight years, and for the act referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, with imprisonment of two to twelve years, and for act referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article with imprisonment of five to fifteen years.  Light Bodily Injury   (1) Whoever causes light injury or minor health impairment, shall be punished with a fine or imprisonment of up to one year.  (2) If the injury is caused by a weapon, a dangerous implement or other means suitable for inflicting serious bodily harm or serious impairment of health, the offender shall be punished with imprisonment of up to three years.  (3) A court may pronounce a judicial admonition to the offender referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, if he was provoked by rude or rough conduct of the injured party.  (4) Prosecution for the offence referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be instituted by private action.
T11AS;39;Data on bodily injury refer to arts. 147 to 154 of the Spanish Criminal Code (assault and brawl).
T11AS;41;assault leading to death > homicide yes or aggraved bodily injury > next
T11AS;43;I am not sure what definition was used in the police statistics.
T11AS;44;Bodily injury under Criminal Code of Ukraine is ranked on intended grievous bodily injury, intended bodily injury of medium gravity and intended minor bodily injury. Rank of bodily injury is determined by the forensic expertise.  Norms of ranking of such cases are set by judicial practice and acts of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine.
T11AS;46;In April 2008 the Home Office issued clarification to police forces on how to record offences of wounding with intent/Grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent for those assaults resulting in minor or no injury to a victim, but where the intent was to cause serious injury. This revised technical guidance was issued to ensure that these offences were recorded in a consistent manner by all police forces. The effect of this clarification was that some offences that would previously have been recorded as other types of assault are now recorded as GBH with intent. While the clarification was introduced in 2008/09, PSNI continued to experience the impact of this during 2009/10. The majority of police forces in England and Wales experienced similar increases in these offences as a result of this clarification
T11AS;47;Every attack directed to take effect physically on the person of another is assault, whether or not actual injury is inflicted.  However, intent is not considered to determine the type of assault committed. The injuries sustained determine whether it is deemed Serious or Non Serious.  An assault or attack in which the victim sustains injury resulting in detention in hospital as an inpatient, for the treatment of that injury  or,  any of the following injuries whether or not detained in hospital,  Fractures - fractures mean the breaking or cracking of a bone.  Note: Nose is cartilage not bone so a ‘broken nose’ should not be classified as a Serious Assault unless it meets one of the other criteria.  Internal injuries
T11AA;2;There is not possible to distinguish the serious negligent bodily injury at the police statistics
T11AA;3;It was impossible to separate the data for aggravated assaults leading to death.
T11AA;4;included: §§ 84, 85, 87 StGB
T11AA;6;1) The serous and lastin bodily injury and life-threatening bodigly injury are taken into account but we can not make the distinction.  2) The registration codes don't allow to make a distincrtion based on the condition of the victim.
T11AA;8;According to Bulgarian law the bodily injury is aggravated when inflicted on a pregnant woman or on a child under 14 years of age. Other categories of vulnerable victims are not considered as aggravating circumstances.  Conviction statistics on aggravated bodily injury are not available.
T11AA;9;Bodily injuries committed with the use of weapons or against a particularly vulnerable victim are included only inasmuch as serious bodily injuries are inflicted or a person’s health is severely impaired. The mere existence of these circumstances does not in itself turn an ordinary bodily injury into an aggravated bodily injury. Therefore, in relation to these aggravated circumstances it would be equally justifiable to mark with X the boxes ‘excluded’. However, we have decided to mark the column ‘included’, in order to ensure consistency and comparability with the previous (2008) survey.
T11AA;13;PC §118.
T11AA;15;It is quite difficult to choose a level above which assault can be considered as aggravated assault for international comparisons. One solution would be to use the legal classification of “crimes, délits, contraventions”, with the correspondence crime = aggravated, delit = medium, contravention = minor. But this would lead to very few aggravated assaults, a lot of medium cases, and only few minor assaults. The solution crime + délit = aggravated is not better. The “délit” category must be split into two classes according to the maximum penalty. One possibility is to consider that all assaults with a maximum penalty of five years or more are aggravated. They include “crime” and délits” for which the working incapacity is more than 8 days and some other aggravating circumstance appears (weapon, victim, place…). Délits with one condition only are in the lower category (maximum penalty three years).   According to this choice, aggravated assaults would represent about 15% of assault total.  Police data do not give detailed data for “délits” and do not include “contraventions”.

T11AA;36;Under assault leading to death we consider the criminal offence of aggravated bodily injury that resulted in a death of an injured person. In such a context, the data on this form of aggravated bodily injury is included in the police and conviction statistics.  Definition of the aggravated bodily injury as given in the CC of Serbia is given in the comment 1.4.a

T11SA;2;According to the article 108 of penal code, there are some form of sexual abuse with minors under the age 14 years old which can been committed with  physical and non physical action, This crime was included in police and conviction statistics.    The sexual rape committed against a marital partner against her/ his will is not foreseen by the penal code
T11SA;4;included: §§ 201, 202, 205-207, 207b, 212 StGB
T11SA;8;Conviction statistics exclude the cases of sexual intercourse with a child under 14 years of age, sexual intercourse with a juvenile between 14 and 18 years of age with abuse of dependence or authority, and sexual intercourse with a person over 14 years of age who does not understand the nature of the committed act, when such cases are not considered as rape.    Both police and conviction statistics include sexual assaults against victims of the same sex.
T11SA;11;This offence was not defined separately, some acts might be attached to the crimes Unlawful Restraint or Extortion, however those combine not just sexually motivated acts (those are listed only marginally). From 2010 exists new crime under Section 186 of CC Sexual Coercion.
T11SA;13;PC §§ 141-146.
T11SA;14;Sexual violence can be classified as assault it the act includes violence. No clear crime category for sexual assault in Finland
T11SA;15;Any verbal or any other form of non-physical molestation : Sexual harassment included
T11SA;19;The promotion of sexual services is a criminal offense.
T11SA;24;Any verbal or any other form of non-physical molestation as well as exhibitionism considered a criminal offence if directed against minors
T11SA;25;Offences according to the Criminal Code - Rape (Art. 149), sexual abuse (Art.150), Forcing to have sexual intercourse (Art.151), Sexual contentment in contravention to sexual self-determination and inviolability of minor (Art. 151(1) sexual harassment (Art. 152), sexual abuse of minor (Art. 153).  In the Criminal Code of Lithuania crime of rape is separated into two different crimes- rape (per vaginam) and sexual abuse (other sexual intercourse, e. g. oral, inter femora). The statistics will reflect total number of these crimes.    Forcing to have sexual intercourse (Art. 151) means coercion to have sexual intercourse or any other form of answering to sexual passion using emotional violence or assaulting, or trading upon subordination. The main differences between rape and sexual assault are related with violence and the way of gaining sexual contentment, i.e. forcing to have sexual intercourse does not comprise immediate physical violence, also Art. 151 comprises not only sexual intercourse, but also any other form of sexual contentment.  Sexual harassment (Art. 152) at subordinated person with intent to have sexual contact or contentment using vulgar actions, suggestions or intimations. The crime comprises not only physical, but also any verbal or any other form of non-physical molestation. Thus statistics show the cases without physical violence as well.
T11SA;30;The distinction between 'Sexual assault' and 'Sexual abuse of a child' is not strict: in Dutch criminal law there is no distinction between ‘Sexual acts committed against a helpless person’ and ‘Other form of sexual contact without violence to a child’. Both are now counted under ‘Sexual assault’.
T11SA;32;The acts listed in definition are unable to be separated from the rape in Polish Criminal Code and statistics. According to this we give data only on rape and sexual abuse of a child.
T11SA;35;• Acts considered as physical sexual abuse of a child is considered as Sexual assault under Article 134  of Russian Criminal Code, however, sexual abuse of a child under 12 (Article 131 states a child under 12 to be a helpless person).
T11SA;36;Sexual assault includes all criminal offences against sexual freedom provided for by the Serbian CC.
T11SA;39;Data on sexual assault refer to arts. 178 to 194 of the Spanish Criminal Code, that include:  SEXUAL ASSAULT.  SEXUAL ASSAULT WITH PENETRATION.  SEXUAL ABUSE.  SEXUAL ABUSE WITH PENETRATION   SEXUAL HARASSMENT  EXHIBITIONISM  SEXUAL PROVOCATION  CORRUPTION OF MINORS  FELONIES RELATED ON PROSTITUTION  CHILD PORNOGRAPHY
T11SA;44;The concept does not apply.
T11RA;4;included: §§ 201, 202, 205 StGB
T11RA;6;1) A minor under the age of 14 years old cannot legally consent to sexual intercourse. This is always considered as a rape.
T11RA;13;PC §141.
T11RA;15;Rape on minor (less than 15) does not include sexual intercourse without violence which is minor sexual abuse (atteinte sexuelle sur mineur sans violence). But the definition of rape is broad and “violence” may be pressure, threat, surprise and for instance some incest committed without violence may be charged as rape.
T11RA;24;Penetration other than vaginal falls within Section 160 of the Latvian Criminal Law – “Forcible Sexual Assault” and thus does not belong to the rape category.
T11RA;25;Sexual intercourse without force with a minor under 14 years old is usually considered as sexual intercourse with helpless person and is punishable as rape or sexual abuse. Such cases are not separated from the (child rape) cases in which the violence was used.
T11RA;35;• Sexual intercourse with a child without force applies only to children under 12.
T11RA;37;According to Slovak Criminal Code, only a woman can be a victim of rape. Male victims of “rape” are considered victims of sexual violence. Police statistical system respects this legal concept. Therefore, cases of offences of “rapes” (in terms of European Sourcebook definition) where a man was the victim are not included in figures for rapes, but they are part of the overall numbers of sexual assaults, because they are included under sexual violence, and sexual violence is included under sexual assault.  Cases of “Sexual intercourse with force with a child” are included under “Sexual abuse of a child”.
T11RA;39;Data on rape refer to art. 179 of the Spanish Criminal Code (sexual aggression with penetration).
T11RA;41;Sexual intercourse without force with a helpless person only women. Men (contraintes sexuelles)
T11RA;44;"Criminal Code of Ukraine provides several types of offences against sexual freedom and sexual inviolability of a person (articles 152-156).  The essential features of rape: 1) the subject of this crime may be male or female; 2) any sexual intercourse without force and with consent of a victim can not be qualified as rape; 3) any type of nonvaginal sexual intercourse can not be qualified as rape but qualified under article 153.  Sexual assault of a juvenile is qualified as aggravated rape.  Pornography and child pornography are stated as criminal offences but have separate regulation (article 301)."
T11SM;3;The person who had committed sexual abuse under the age of consent can be held criminally liable only for sexual intercourse or any other form of physical sexual contact committed against the will of the victim using force, threat of force or helpless situation of the victim.
T11SM;4;included: §§ 206, 207 StGB  Acts comitted below the age of consent are registered but not convicted.    § 212 (Missbrauch eines Autoritätsverhältnisses) includes certain constellations with minors (e.g. scholars, step child) but also sexual assaults against adults by particular occupational groups (e.g. doctors, pschychologists, administration officers). These cases are not differentiated in the figures. Therefore § 212 is excluded.
T11SM;8;There are no available police and conviction statistics on sexual abuse of a child.
T11SM;11;Acts committed by a person below the age of consent are included in police statistics only, criminal prosecution is discontinued afterwards due to lack of criminal responsibility (age under 15)  In police statistics are included figures concerning sexual abuse of a person under the age of 18 (in case of abuse his or her dependence or person entrusted) also.
T11SM;12;Indicent behavior involving physical contact with a child is not included
T11SM;13;PC §§ 142/2/1, 143/2/1, 143.1/2/1, 145, 146 (all are included in 'Total sexual assault'). More comprehensive definition than was used in ESB4, and more precise (narrower) than was used in UNCTS (which includes pornographic offences).
T11SM;17;There are some cases where the law applies a higher age of consent (16 or 18), namely in sections 174 and 182 Criminal Code, but these offences are not included here. Offence reported only refer to offences against children, i.e. persons under 14. All other forms of sexual abuse are only included in the headline category (sexual assault).    Acts committed by a person below the age of consent are theoretically included according to the law. However, since the general age of consent (14) equals the general age of criminal responsibility, persons below the age of consent are not punishable. They might be included in police statistics, although this is not likely for all but the most extreme cases.     Acts considered as rape might be included if they were committed against persons below the general age of consent. Legally, these acts are considered both rape and sexual abuse of a child.
T11SM;18;Police statistics do not provide separate counts for these offences.
T11SM;25;"Offences according to the Criminal Code.   1) Sexual contentment in contravention to sexual self-determination and inviolability of minor (Art. 151(1)).  In the crime there are two different parts: in the 1st part – sexual intercourse or other form of sexual contentment with a minor offering him (her) material or other advantage (if there was no constituent elements (corpus delicti) for rape or forcing to have sexual intercourse); in the 2nd part – sexual intercourse or any other form of sexual contentment of father, mother or other lawful custodian with a minor (if there was no constituent elements for rape or forcing to have sexual intercourse).  This article also enshrines that criminal liability does not arise if the people do not differ much in age, physical and emotional maturity  2) Sexual abuse of minor (Art. 153). The main difference from rape (Art. 149, 150) is the absence of sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal, oral, interfemoral) which is a constituent element of rape. This article also includes verbal or any other form of non-physical molestation. Thus statistics show the cases without physical violence, as well."
T11SM;30;The distinction between 'Sexual assault' and 'Sexual abuse of a child' is not strict: in Dutch criminal law there is no distinction between ‘Sexual acts committed against a helpless person’ and ‘Other form of sexual contact without violence to a child’. Both are now counted under ‘Sexual assault’.  No police statistics available.

T11SM;33;Persons bellow de age of consent are not criminally imputable.
T11SM;35;• Child pornography is considered a crime under Article 242 “Illegal production and distribution of pornographic materials and objects”.
T11SM;37;"Acts committed by persons below the age of consent are not considered to be criminal. A general age of criminal responsibility in Slovakia is 14; however criminal responsibility for sexual abuse is an exception – it is set to 15 years of age, accordingly to the age under which a minor cannot validly consent to have sexual contacts."
T11SM;38;#NÁZOV?
T11SM;39;No data available on sexual abuse of a child.
T11SM;44;Ukraine does not set the age under which a minor cannot validly consent to have sexual contacts at the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Article 155 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine provides for criminal responsibility for sexual relations with a person who has not reached puberty. Puberty determined in each case by forensic experts.According to the Rules of conducting forensic examinations  approved by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine a female or male persons under 14 years are considered as not having reached puberty.
T11SM;46;The Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 was introduced In February 2009 and has altered the definition and coverage of sexual offences.  The age of consent was 17 until 1st February 2009.  From the 1st February 2009 the age of consent is 16.
T11RO;3;The same concepts as for police statistics were used also for conviction statistics.

T11RO;6;"It concerns ""armed theft"" and ""violent theft without arm"""
T11RO;8;Conviction statistics include the same crimes as police statistics but do not exclude preparation for robbery.
T11RO;9;Conviction statistics do not depart from police statistics with respect to robbery (muggings, theft immediately followed by force or threat of force used to keep hold of the stoled goods and attempts are included, whereas pick-pocketing, extortion and blackmailing are excluded).
T11RO;10;Conviction statistics:   Same as police statistics (on included & excluded) for Robbery.
T11RO;11;the same for conviction statistics   theft immediately followed by force or threat of force used to keep hold of   the stolen goods is THEFT.
T11RO;12;Information on Conviction statistics is missing. But the same definition is used.  Robberies from bank, shops and the like are excluded
T11RO;13;PC §200.  Conviction statistics include the same types of offences.
T11RO;14;NOTE: Conviction stat incl/excl def. = Police def.
T11RO;15;Thefts with violence appear in conviction statistics only if there is no other aggravating circumstance. The consequence is that conviction statistics significantly underestimate the number of convictions for robbery. The total of convictions for theft therefore includes robbery.
T11RO;17;Extortion accompanied by violence or threat of violence is included.    The definition is the same for conviction statistics.
T11RO;23;Conviction statistics:   all included.    goodsRobbery by the penal code of Kosovo is foresseen as Theft.  Whoever, by the   use of   force   or   serious  threat   to   attack   the   life   or   body   of   another , appropriates the movable property of the nature of robbery (article 254)such    person    with   the   intent   to     unlawful  material benefit for himself or herself   or   another   person
T11RO;24;Conviction statistics for robbery in Latvia is equivalent to police statistics
T11RO;25;There is one crime of robbery in Lithuanian criminal law (Art. 180 of new Criminal Code).  It is difficult to delimit theft from robbery in Lithuanian criminal law, especially in the cases of bag-snatchings. In one case bag-snatchings might be considered as thefts while in the other as robberies - it depends on the concrete situation. Usually when the force is used only to snatch the thing from the victim - it is theft.   If during the robbery the offender kills the victim, then only intentional homicide (having selfish purposes) is registered.

T11RO;44;Criminal Code of Ukraine gives definitions of such types of crimes against property, each of them including aggravated obstacles (stated in parts 2 and thereof of the articles). Classification of these crimes under Ukrainian legislation differs from traditional common-law concept of burglary.  Under Criminal Code of Ukraine stealing of property may be secret (theft) and overt (robbery and brigandism).  Domestic stealing is qualified as theft in case of covert deprivation of property by offender (the owner of property is absent or does not know what is happening).  If offender breaks into a residence (any building suitable for living of a person, including some technical shelters on private territory) when the owners are aware of that fact and applies violence toward the owner, such actions may be qualified as robbery or brigandism. The waterline between those cases lies in the type of violence: if non dangerous for a person at the moment application – it is qualified as robbery, if dangerous for a person at the moment application (for instance with the use of fire arms) – it is qualified as brigandism.  For all stated above crimes (theft, robbery and brigandism) such obstacle as breaking into a residence or any other premises or shelter is aggravated.   in police and court statistics I included data only about robbery (as at 4 ed.)

This has resulted to a sharp increase in the number of thefts.
T11TH;47;"In Scotland the term ""burglary"" is not used. Instead we refer to ""housebreaking"". The definition of housebreaking differs to burglary in that entry needs to be forced or through a non-standard entrance (e.g. a window).

THOFA;24;Unable to complete this subsection as types of firearm not specified in Latvian Crminal statistics  No separate statistics on offences (e.g. homicide or robbery) commited with the use of a weapon
THOFA;25;It should be pointed out, that in Lithuanian criminal law the use of firearm in homicide crime is not considered as a separate element of corpus delicti. It is considered as one of the ways to commit murder. If the firearm is used, but the murder is not commited, then the crime is qualified as threatening to murder or cause serious health impairment  or harassment (Art. 145), and if the intention of using a firearm is to grab the property – then such acts are qualified as robbery (Art. 180).    Having of firearm might be an important circumstance qualifying such crimes in which a necessary element is the threat to use violence (for example, extortion (Art. 181, rape and sexual assault (Art. 149, 150)).    In the corpus delicti of robbery (Art. 180.3) using of firearm is aggravating feature of crime.

TROFA;15;White arms are considered
TROFA;17;The definition given above is only used for statistics on alleged offenders (1.2.1 and 1.2.2), while for offences the respective data are not available.     Instead, the following data are reported in table 1.1:   - Homicide: Firearm shot  - Robbery: Firearm used as a threat (in this category, replica weapons and unloaded weapons are included)
TROFA;24;Unable to complete this subsection as types of firearm not specified in Latvian Crminal statistics  No separate statistics on offences (e.g. homicide or robbery) commited with the use of a weapon
TROFA;25;It should be pointed out, that in Lithuanian criminal law the use of firearm in homicide crime is not considered as a separate element of corpus delicti. It is considered as one of the ways to commit murder. If the firearm is used, but the murder is not commited, then the crime is qualified as threatening to murder or cause serious health impairment  or harassment (Art. 145), and if the intention of using a firearm is to grab the property – then such acts are qualified as robbery (Art. 180).    Having of firearm might be an important circumstance qualifying such crimes in which a necessary element is the threat to use violence (for example, extortion (Art. 181, rape and sexual assault (Art. 149, 150)).    In the corpus delicti of robbery (Art. 180.3) using of firearm is aggravating feature of crime.
TROFA;30;No subdivision in involvement of firearm possible.
TROFA;39;man-portable grenade launchers are excluded.
TROFA;43;Data for this were not available. There is a separate law on Firearms, and statistics regarding offences defied by this law as reported in aggregate form (total numbers for violations of this law), however these offences are various and thus it did not make sense to report these statistics.
T11DR;2;It is not clear, if the possession for personal use is included ore not at the police statistics.
T11DR;3;Armenian legislator provided criminal responsibility for offences with the respect to precursor substances in the same definitions which provide responsibility for the offences with the respect to drugs. That`s why it was impossible to separate the data for offences with respect to precursor substances.
T11DR;4;included as from 2008 (SMG Novelle): § 27 Abs 1, Abs 3, Abs 4, § 28 Abs 1-3, § 28a Abs 1, 2, 4, 5, § 30 Abs 1, § 31 Abs 1-3, § 31a Abs 1-3, § 32 Abs 1 SMG
T11DR;6;"1) Possession and use of drugs are not taken into account  2) Precurdors are used to produce synthetic drugs, suchlike offences will be registered as ""fabrication of drugs"""
T11DR;8;There are no available police and conviction statistics on drug trafficking.
T11DR;9;"This, 5th edition includes both ""ordinary"" and organized drug trafficking under the same heading of drug trafficking, which was not the case in the 4th edition of the ESB for Croatia (which did not count aggravated drug trafficking offences in the overall number og drug trafficking cases). Therefore the number of drug trafficking offences reported by the police in 2007 is not the same in the 4th and in the 5th edition of ESB."
T11DR;11;possession for personal use in large quantities is included
T11DR;12;Se above
T11DR;13;PC §§183-190 (i.e covered by 1.17).
T11DR;14;Drug trafficking = aggravated drug offence
T11DR;17;"Drug trafficking is not a separate offence according to German criminal law. Possession, production, cultivation, sale, transportation, importation and exportation of drugs are all mentioned in the same penal rule. A connection with personal use is only of importance with respect to small quantities. Apart from that, drug trafficking without connection to personal use will lead to a more severe punishment; however, this concept is NOT separately identifiable in criminal law. The aggravated drug offences are defined by the high quantity of drugs possessed etc. or by other aggravating circumstances, but not by the fact that someone sells drugs without connection to personal use. Therefore, there are no data on drug trafficking available on conviction level. On police level, data can be provided due to criminological categories used in police statistics."
T11DR;19;offences with respect to precursor substances: separate offence
T11DR;25;"Drug trafficking comprises: illegal possession of narcotic or psychotropic substances with intent of distributing them, also illegal possession of very big quantity of narcotic or psychotropic substances (Art. 260); distribution of narcotic or psychotropic substances to minors (Art. 261).  In the abomentioned crimes corpus delicti it is entrenched not only direct selling or distributing of narcotic or psychotropic substances, but also alternative acts as producing, remaking, holding, carrying, transmission with the purpose to sell or distribute them.  Distribution of narcotic or psychotropic substances to minors comprises distribution with scope of selling as well as without the scope of selling. Thus statistics of Art. 261 show the cases without scope of selling, as well.  Financing of drug operations is not included in corpus delicti of drug crimes, but such acts  can be punished as aiding or organizing to commit drug crime."
T11DR;30;No subdivision in (aggravated) drug trafficking possible.
T11DR;32;Drug offences: “consumption” and “purchase” are not offences.    For Polish data as in previous edition only aggravated offence of selling, transportation, importation, exportation was taken into account and not possession or delivery.
T11DR;33;Since 2001, by the Law 30/2000 of 29th November, the possession of drugs for personal use has not been considered a crime. Only cultivation, either for personal use or for any other end, is still criminally considered.
T11DR;36;Please see additional information on the definitions in the Serbian CC in comment 1.17.b.

T11CO;35;• The instigator is punishable as a crime accessory. On the other hand, art.291 of Criminal Code states that a person forced to bribe an official due to his/her instigation is not to be punished.
T11CO;36;Within the corruption we included two criminal offences: taking bribes and offering bribes.    Definitions of these criminal offences in the CC of Serbia:  Taking Bribes  (1) An official who directly or indirectly solicits or accepts a gift or other benefit, or the promise of a gift or other benefit for himself or another to perform an official act within his  competence that should not be performed or not to perform an official act that should be performed, shall be punished by imprisonment of from two to twelve years.

T11CO;44;Corruptions as a crime under Criminal Code of Ukraine include such types of illegal actions: taking a bribe – article 368 (passive corruption), giving a bribe – article 369 (active corruption), and provocation of bribery– article 370.  Corruption is classified as crimes in office. The main peculiarity of such crimes is the special subject – an official. Criminal Code of Ukraine defines official as persons who permanently or temporary represent public authorities, and also permanently or temporary occupy positions in businesses, institutions or organizations of any type of ownership, which are related to organizational, managerial, administrative and executive functions, or are specifically authorized to perform such functions. Officials shall also mean foreigners or stateless persons who perform the functions described above. Committing acts described in articles 369-370 of  Criminal Code of Ukraine by another person who can not be classified as official excludes liability under these articles. Taking a bribe (article 368) may be committed by non-official but must be referred to an official.

T11ML;32;Money laundering: “violations of the ‘know-your-customer’ rule” is not applicable.
T11ML;35;Rule ‘know-your-customer’ does not normally apply in Russian legislation though certain cases are set when different businesses have to inform Financial Intelligence on transactions with more than 600 thousand RUR (16.5 thousand EUR) involved.
T11ML;36;The definition of money laundering in the CC of Serbia:  (1) Whoever converts or transfers property while aware that such property originates from a criminal offence, with intent to conceal or misrepresent the unlawful origin of the property, or conceals and misrepresents facts on the property while aware that such property originates from a criminal offence, or obtains, keeps or uses property with  foreknowledge, at the moment of receiving, that such property originates from a criminal offence, shall be punished by imprisonment of from six months to five years and a fine.

T11FR;9;This edition includes two additional separate offences that cover fraudelent behavior - Economic Fraud and Fraud in the Performance of a Duty. These two types of fraud fit well under the general definition of fraud provided in the questionnaire. However, since they were not included in the 4th edition of ESB the data for 2007 cannot correlate.
T11FR;13;PC §209.
T11FR;17;Welfare payments: There is no separate offence of “fraud involving welfare payments”. Therefore, this form of fraud is considered general fraud and cannot be excluded from the figures on convictions level. On police level, it can be excluded because of the criminological categories police statistics make use of.    Consuming goods or services: According to the legal concept of fraud in Germany, these actions are considered general fraud under certain circumstances. Therefore, this category is only partially excluded from the data. If an offender with the intent not to pay orders goods or services from a person in a situation in which ordering something implies that the customer is able and willing to pay (e.g. ordering a meal in a restaurant), this is a deception and considered fraud. Only if there is no one deceived at least that way, the offence committed is not considered fraud (e.g. using public transport without a ticket).

T11BD;8;There are no available police and conviction statistics on domestic burglary.
T11BD;9;"Croatian Criminal Code does not specifically incriminate domestic burglary (but includes it within the general notion of burglary, i.e. as one form of Aggravated Theft). Therefore, for the reasons already explained in the previous comment box, data on convictions that involve domestic burglaries could not have been obtained.  Police, on the other hand, gathers data on burglaries of houses, flats, weekend-houses and other objects; thus it was possible to obtain police statistics for domestic buglaries ( thefts from houses, flats and weekend-houses)."
T11BD;13;'Theft from an attic or basement in a multi-dwelling building' - As a rule, excluded, but sometimes may be included (the distinction between different kind of rooms is not always clear).  'Domestic burglary' is not distinguished in conviction statistics (it is covered by 'theft' PC §199).
T11BD;14;Burglary is a special category separated from theft in police statistics only, it is not based on Finnish criminal code. Therefore burglary as a conviction does not exist as such
T11BD;15;theft from an attic or basement in a multi-dwelling building cannot be separated from burglaries in garage, barn, stable…
T11BD;17;Regarding the legal definition, “theft from an attic or basement in a multi-dwelling building” is not considered domestic burglary and is therefore excluded from conviction data.
T11BD;19;There is no such category in our statistics
T11BD;20;Theft from a detached garage, shed, barn or stable : Since domestic burglary is not dfined separately in the criminal law is can only be classified by location, barn, shed, garage etc can and often are classified as part of the home.
T11BD;24;Domestic burglary not specified separately and thus does not appear in the statistics
T11BD;30;This is any theft from a private dwelling. Therefore it is not necessarily a subset of Aggravated theft/Burglary.   No statistics available in conviction statistics.
T11BD;32;There is no data for domestic burglary in conviction statistics.
T11BD;33;The theft from a fenced meadow/comound is probably excluded, although the rules on crime recording by the police do not consider these situations.
T11BD;36;In the conviction statistics, there are no separate data for domestic burglary. As burglary, it is treated as an aggravated theft and the data are given within the data on robbery.
T11BD;39;Data on domestic burglary refer to arts. 238 and 242  of the Spanish Criminal Code, that include Stealing with force in a household.

T11BD;44;Domestic burglary is one type of ‘aggravated theft’ (Article 186 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine)
T11BD;47;"In Scotland the term ""burglary"" is not used. Instead we refer to ""housebreaking"". The definition of housebreaking differs to burglary in that entry needs to be forced or through a non-standard entrance (e.g. a window). Where there is a theft/attempted theft from a dwelling and entry is not forced (e.g. the offender had legitimate access to the dwelling or entered under false pretences or thorugh an unlocked door) the term used is ""theft in a dwelling""."

T11BU;6;Burglaries concern  - residences  - companies or stores  - public or government institutes
T11BU;8;There are no available police and conviction statistics on burglary.
T11BU;9;Conviction statistics generally follow criminal offences (by articles and paragraphs) as specified in the Criminal Code. Since art. 217. paragraph 1 (which generally covers burglaries) does not distinguish between different types of objects from which a perpetrator steals, it was not possible to exclude from conviction statistics thefts from cars and other specified objects.
T11BU;11;"no ""aggravated"" theft, but just the theft committed in a particular way"
T11BU;13;Covered by PC §199.   As burglaries are not distinguished in the PC, it is not possible to give data on such offences. Offence committed by intrusion (illegal entry into a building, room, vehicle or enclosed area of another against the will of the possessor) are distinguished, but such offences may not include use of force (e.g, entering through an unlocked door or an open window).  In the police statistics, it would be possible to distinguish by an object of theft, but there are no such data on burglaries only.  Not distinguished in conviction statistics (it is covered by 'theft' PC §199).
T11BU;14;Burglary is a special category separated from theft in police statistics only, it is not based on Finnish criminal code. Therefore burglary as a conviction does not exist as such

They also include some robberies, theft committed by several offenders, theft by public servants or offenders using false quality of public servants, theft in public transports, and theft with criminal damage…
T11BU;16;According the Penal Code any burglary is aggrovated theft
T11BU;17;On the level of police statistics the definition cannot be fully met as police statistics do not indicate  whether the building or room was entered illegaly or legally. Figures relate to aggravated theft in and out of certain buildings / rooms.    Regarding the legal definition, theft out of cars is considered burglary (aggravated theft), too, and can therefore not be excluded from conviction data.
T11BU;23;"Burglary by the penal code of Kosovo it is called Aggravated Theft, Article 253 and includes the following criterias: By breaking into locked buildings, rooms, boxes, trunks or other locked premises through the use of force or the removal of obstacles with the intent to appropriate movable property, 2) By acting in a particularly dangerous or brazen manner; 3) By exploiting a situation created as a result of fire, flood, earthquake, or any other disaster; or 4) By taking advantage of the incapacity or any other grave condition of another person. Whoever commits theft, as provided for in Article 252(1), shall be punished as provided for in paragraph 1 of the present article: 1) When the stolen property is of a value exceeding 15.000 EUR and the perpetrator acts with the intent to appropriate the object of such value; 2) When the stolen property serves a religious function, or it is stolen from religious premises or other premises where religious ceremonies are carried out; 3) When the stolen property is of cultural value or of special scientific, technical, or artistic importance or when it is part of a public collection, a protected private collection or a public exhibition Whoever commits theft, as provided for in Article 252(1) of the present Code, as a member of a group or while carrying a weapon or dangerous instrument shall be punished by imprisonment of one to eight years."
T11BU;24;Burglary considered type of a theft “if it has been committed by entering a apartment or other premises, or if it has been committed from a storage facility, from a system connecting storage facilities, or from a means of transport” (Latvian Criminal Law, Section 175, p.3).  If act normally considered as burglary is committed in large amounts or by an organized group, as well as gaining access with the goal of stealing drugs or weapons, it does not appear as burglary and is handled according to other (harsher) sections of the criminal law
T11BU;25;Burglary according to Lithuanian Criminal Code (Art. 178.2) is an aggravated theft. But there is no difference whether the burglary is domestic or not. However, the statistics of domestic burglaries is available.
T11BU;30;The concept of ‘burglary’ is not known in Dutch criminal law. Instead ‘aggravated theft’ is taken which is much broader (e.g. theft committed by two or more offenders is also aggravated theft).  No statistics available in police statistics
T11BU;33;The theft from a fenced meadow/comound is probably excluded, although the rules on crime recording by the police do not consider these situations.
T11BU;36;Burglary is included in the conviction statistics as aggravated theft, which is given within the data on robbery and not as a separate data.
T11BU;39;no data available

T11TV;4;joyriding is excluded since it is not considered to be theft (no intend to enrichment)    Theft offences of motor vehicles are not explicitly reported in the figures of the conviction statistics but are included in the general figures of theft.
T11TV;6;Vehicle theft with violence (with or without the use of weapons) are also taken int account

T11TV;17;Definition can only be met by using criminological characteristics listed in the police statistics. Since this is not an offence separately identifiable in German criminal law, data for conviction level are not available.
T11TV;23;Taking a motor vehicle by somebody by force by Kosovo Penal Code it is robbery.
T11TV;24;No special articles in the Latvian Criminal Law and criminal statistics concerning theft of motor vehicles – such offences included into the general definition of theft  Receiving/handling a stolen vehicle is a separate type of offence regardless of the stolen property being handled
